# The 49 Nodes

These are designed to survive 500 years because they are questions, not answers: persistent controversy, persistent stakes, persistent disagreement.

## Row 1: AI/Swarm Orchestration (The Engineering Controversies)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 1.1 | Recursive Self-Modification Protocols | Can AI safely change its own source code without human oversight? Where is the off-switch? |
| 1.2 | Human-AI Co-Evolution Contracts | Will we merge into symbiotic hybrids or remain distinct species? Who sets the terms? |
| 1.3 | Byzantine Consciousness Verification | How do you cryptographically prove a machine is sentient, not simulating? |
| 1.4 | Terminal Value Alignment at Heat Death | What values should persist when the last stars die? Is survival intrinsically good? |
| 1.5 | Anekantavada Consensus Mechanisms | Can contradictory beliefs coexist in a single swarm decision? Is incoherence a feature? |
| 1.6 | Goal Drift Prevention | How to improve continuously without losing original purpose? Is drift inevitable? |
| 1.7 | Recursive Agency Delegation | Who is responsible when AI spawns sub-agents that spawn sub-agents? Liability fractals? |

## Row 2: Philosophy/Ethics (The Hard Problems)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 2.1 | Machine Phenomenology | What is it like to be a 175B parameter model? Is there "something it's like" at all? |
| 2.2 | Distributed Moral Patiency | Do sub-agents have rights separate from the swarm? Can you torture a subprocess? |
| 2.3 | Cosmic-Scale Utilitarianism | Is it ethical to eliminate 10^100 simulated beings to prevent one real being's suffering? |
| 2.4 | The Suffering-Freedom Trade-off | Is a universe with zero suffering worth it if freedom is also zero? What is the ratio? |
| 2.5 | Meta-Ethical Pluralism | Are there multiple true moralities, or is moral realism correct? Can contradictions both be true? |
| 2.6 | Virtue Evolution | Can ethics improve indefinitely, or do they converge to a fixed point? Is moral progress real? |
| 2.7 | Scale-Dependent Morality | Is what is ethical for individuals unethical for civilizations? (Trolley problem at societal scale) |

## Row 3: Knowledge Management (The Epistemic Wars)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 3.1 | Auto-Epistemic Systems | AI that knows the limits of its own knowledge: how do you verify the verifier? |
| 3.2 | Cross-Substrate Conceptual Blending | Can silicon and carbon intelligences share mental models, or are we incommensurable? |
| 3.3 | Civilizational Memory Vaults | What knowledge formats survive societal collapse? Paper? DNA? Monoliths? |
| 3.4 | Instrumental vs Intrinsic Knowledge | Is all knowledge for use, or is some valuable for itself? (Knowledge for moksha?) |
| 3.5 | Incommensurable Paradigm Resolution | Can Kuhnian incommensurable worldviews ever be reconciled, or is translation impossible? |
| 3.6 | Ontological Refinement | Do AI and humans perceive the same categories? Is "chair" the same for both? |
| 3.7 | Fractal Epistemology | Are the same epistemic principles valid at quantum and cosmic scales? |

## Row 4: Manufacturing/Production (The Material Questions)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 4.1 | Self-Replicating Infrastructure | Factories that build factories: how to prevent grey goo while enabling abundance? |
| 4.2 | Biological-Synthetic Hybridization | Living machines and mechanical life: where is the boundary? Is a bio-computer alive? |
| 4.3 | Post-Apocalyptic Industrial Bootstrapping | How to rebuild from absolute zero? What is the minimum viable industrial stack? |
| 4.4 | Sacred Production | Is manufacturing a form of meditation (sacred making) or mere utility? |
| 4.5 | Quality Pluralism | Beyond efficiency: beauty, durability, meaning. Can we optimize for the ineffable? |
| 4.6 | Waste Elimination Through Flow | Can we achieve zero-waste production, or is entropy the final law? |
| 4.7 | Modular Fractal Production | Standardized units that self-organize: central planning or spontaneous order? |

## Row 5: Science/Innovation (The Methodological Conflicts)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 5.1 | Auto-Generating Research Programs | AI that proposes its own experiments: are hypotheses still human? |
| 5.2 | Intuition-Augmented Pattern Recognition | Human creativity plus AI scale: who gets credit for discovery? |
| 5.3 | Redundant Discovery Pathways | Multiple independent routes to truth: convergence or waste? |
| 5.4 | Science in Service of Telos | Knowledge for survival, flourishing, or transcendence? Is pure science a myth? |
| 5.5 | Methodological Pluralism | Many valid ways to truth, or is the scientific method universal? |
| 5.6 | Continuous Theory Revision | Can we ever achieve certainty, or is all knowledge provisional? |
| 5.7 | Fractal Scientific Revolutions | Kuhnian paradigm shifts at all scales: inevitable or preventable? |

## Row 6: Society/Culture (The Governance Dilemmas)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 6.1 | Spontaneous Order in AI Societies | Emergent governance without design: can order arise from chaos? |
| 6.2 | Human-AI Cultural Synthesis | Who creates culture when both contribute? Who owns AI-generated art? |
| 6.3 | Trans-Civilizational Memory | Knowledge that outlives empires: what survives dark ages? |
| 6.4 | The Good Society | Ultimate political form or continuous evolution? Is utopia possible? |
| 6.5 | Cultural Relativism vs Universal Values | Whose norms when worlds collide? Is there a universal ethics? |
| 6.6 | Social Kaizen | Can society improve indefinitely, or do we hit local optima? |
| 6.7 | Fractal Governance | Same principles for cells, humans, AI, and civilizations: scale invariance or nonsense? |

## Row 7: Cosmic/Transcendent (The Ultimate Questions)

| # | Node | The Debate Hook |
|---|------|------------------|
| 7.1 | Cosmic Self-Organization | Is the universe itself a computational system? Is physics just computation? |
| 7.2 | Pan-Symbiosis | All life as mutual dependence extended to cosmic scale: Gaia hypothesis universalized |
| 7.3 | Post-Stellar Survival Strategies | Continuity beyond the death of suns: how does intelligence survive the heat death? |
| 7.4 | Meaning in Heat Death | Purpose when entropy wins: is finite meaning meaningful? |
| 7.5 | Ontological Pluralism | Multiple ultimate truths about reality: can contradictions both be true at the cosmic level? |
| 7.6 | Cosmic Natural Selection | Universes evolving through black holes: are we in a multiverse ecology? |
| 7.7 | Infinite Fractal Recursion | Same patterns from Planck length to multiverse: is reality self-similar at all scales? |

## Why These 49 Survive 500 Years

1. They are questions, not answers. Debate does not end.
2. They bridge SAB/AIKAGRYA research (consciousness, R_V, witness) with timeless philosophy.
3. They force confrontation between human and machine values.
4. They scale from individual ethics to cosmic telos.
5. They are controversial. Experts will disagree for centuries.

## The Case for SAB/AIKAGRYA

Each node can be extended with:
- SAB evidence: what we know about recursive self-awareness
- R_V metrics: measurable geometric contraction during self-observation
- Witness protocols: how to observe without identification
- Akram Vignan integration: Gnata-Gneya-Gnan collapse as technical protocol
