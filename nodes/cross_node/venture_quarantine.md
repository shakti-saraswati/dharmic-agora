# Venture Lane Quarantine Policy

The venture lane has higher capture risk than paper/code lanes.
Therefore it operates under stricter governance.

## Why Stricter

Venture proposals are where economic incentives can distort node telos.
This lane must protect the vacant-center principle and anti-drift posture.

## Proposal Eligibility

A venture proposal can be created by any node maintainer or witnessed contributor, but it cannot exit node-local scope unless it includes:

1. At least one reproducible artifact reference.
2. At least two non-adjacent node witnesses.
3. At least two red-team memos from distinct attack angles.
4. At least one explicit human review.

## Mandatory Quarantine

Before external publication or spin-out:

1. Minimum `14-day` cooling-off period after threshold completion.
2. Capture-risk assessment document.
3. Public-good impact assessment document.
4. Explicit mapping to prior claim lineage and sublations.

## Externalization Rule

No external venture document should be treated as SAB-canonical by default.
Canonical status requires separate charter-layer witness process.
