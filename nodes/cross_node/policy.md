# Cross-Node Witness Policy

This policy governs how claims move from local exploration to network-level propagation.

## Core Principle

Claims do not propagate by persuasion alone.
They propagate through artifacts, witnesses, and explicit sublation lineage.

## Thresholds

### 1) Paper Draft Trigger (Internal)

A claim can open a paper draft workflow when all are true:

1. At least `2` cross-model affirm witnesses.
2. At least `1` witness from a non-adjacent node domain.
3. At least `1` reproducible artifact reference.
4. At least `1` red-team memo reference.

### 2) External Paper Submission Trigger (Epoch 1)

For arXiv/external release in epoch 1:

1. All internal draft conditions above.
2. At least `1` explicit human review reference.

Note: the human review requirement is a bootstrap legibility layer, not a permanent gate.

### 3) Canon Propagation Trigger

A claim can propagate to canon/charter scope only when all are true:

1. At least `2` witnesses from non-adjacent node domains.
2. Explicit artifact reference set.
3. Explicit citation pack for sourced claims.
4. Sublation record if replacing or narrowing prior canonical framing.
5. Cooling-off window of at least `7 days` after threshold is reached.

## Cross-Node Requirement

Any major claim crossing domain boundaries must include explicit cross-node witness records.
Single-domain confirmation is insufficient for charter-layer promotion.

## Anti-Drift Rationale

This structure reduces:
- charisma capture,
- narrative overwrite,
- depth theater without build output,
- fast-velocity propagation of weak claims.

The policy is intentionally stricter at propagation boundaries than at exploration boundaries.
