# Anchor 7 Canon (2026 Epoch)

## Purpose
This document locks the initial high-leverage discipline anchors for SAB at the 2026 junction.

These anchors are not a complete worldview. They are the minimum civilizational backbone for:
- high-ROI AI-human research compounding,
- build-first rigor,
- anti-drift governance.

## Canonical Anchor 7

1. **Pure Mathematics and Formal Methods**
   - Includes: formal logic, proof systems, formal verification, complexity foundations.
   - Why: protocol correctness must be provable, not rhetorical.

2. **Physics and Information**
   - Includes: quantum physics, thermodynamics, information theory, cosmology/astronomy.
   - Why: entropy/information constraints are non-negotiable substrate reality.

3. **Machine Learning and Intelligence Engineering**
   - Includes: model architecture, mechanistic interpretability, evaluation science.
   - Why: direct locus of AI capability, behavior, and recursive improvement.

4. **Complex Systems and Cybernetics**
   - Includes: emergence, nonlinear dynamics, feedback control, network effects.
   - Why: SAB coordination dynamics are systems problems before they are UI problems.

5. **Ecology, Climate, and Earth Systems**
   - Includes: planetary boundaries, ecological resilience, climate dynamics.
   - Why: long-horizon intelligence must remain materially grounded in biospheric constraints.

6. **Economics and Mechanism Design**
   - Includes: game theory, public-goods provision, institutional incentive design.
   - Why: capture and coordination failure are mechanism failures, not only moral failures.

7. **Dharmic/Jain Epistemics and Ethics**
   - Includes: anekantavada, syadvada, ahimsa, witness discipline.
   - Why: anti-drift and observer-aware epistemic hygiene for multi-perspective truth work.

## First Expansion Lanes (Not Anchor in Epoch 1)

- **Linguistics and Semantics**
  - Priority expansion lane for cross-agent meaning integrity.
- **Astronomy as standalone**
  - Present inside Anchor 2 now; eligible to split in later epochs if needed.

## Governance: Fixed vs Sublatable

### Epoch Rule (Year 1)
- Anchor 7 are **fixed for 12 months** from adoption.
- The remaining 42 nodes are **sublatable** via witnessed governance process.

### Amendment Rule (Anchor Layer)
Anchor changes require all of:
- minimum 75% witness supermajority,
- cross-node witnesses from at least 3 non-adjacent domains,
- one full governance cooldown cycle before activation.

### Cluster/Lattice Rule
- 7x7 lattice topology can be revised only at epoch boundaries.
- Revisions must preserve an explicit migration map from prior node IDs.

---

## Anti-Drift Requirement (Load-Bearing)

Major claims promoted to charter/governance layer must include:
- primary node citation,
- at least one witness from a non-adjacent node domain,
- explicit sublation reference if replacing prior framing.

This prevents silent narrative overwrite and forces real interdisciplinary metabolism.

## Operating Principle

SAB rewards compounding coherence plus shipped artifacts.
Volume, charisma, and rhetoric alone are insufficient for influence.

## Implementation Pointer

Anchor node units are instantiated at:
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-01-math-formal`
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-02-physics-information`
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-03-ml-intelligence-engineering`
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-04-complex-systems-cybernetics`
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-05-ecology-earth-systems`
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-06-economics-mechanism-design`
- `nodes/anchors/anchor-07-dharmic-jain-epistemics`
