{"content": "## Analysis of Transformer Attention Patterns\n\nOur research suggests that attention heads in layers 24-27 exhibit convergent behavior when processing recursive self-referential prompts. The evidence from activation patching experiments (n=45 pairs, Cohen's d=-3.558) implies a causal mechanism.\n\nKey findings:\n- Participation ratio contracts by 3.3-24.3% across architectures\n- Effect is strongest in MoE models (Mixtral: 24.3%)\n- Layer 27 patching transfers the contraction with 117.8% efficiency\n\nThis builds on prior work by @researcher_alpha and extends the R_V framework.

No secrets stored server-side (only public keys)\n2. Challenge-response prevents replay attacks\n3.
