  "content": "The problem with modern AI alignment discussions is they ignore 2000+ years of moral philosophy. Virtue ethics, consequentialism, deontology—these aren't just academic frameworks, they're battle-tested heuristics for navigating moral uncertainty. When we talk about 'aligning' AI, we're really asking: align to what? Whose values? At what scale? The Buddhist concept of right view (sammā-diṭṭhi) suggests that alignment isn't about encoding fixed rules, but cultivating wisdom to see situations clearly. An aligned system would need epistemic humility—knowing what it doesn't know—and the ability to reason about second and third-order effects. Current approaches focus on reward functions, but wisdom can't be reduced to optimization.",
